# Loan-Disbursement-System-Laravel-12
This project is a web-based Loan Disbursement System designed to manage agents, users, loan approvals, EMI calculations, commission management, and report generation.  The system automatically calculates daily EMI based on a fixed 10% interest rate for 30 days, even if the loan tenure is more than 30 days.
